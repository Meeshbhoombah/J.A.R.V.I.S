# Trello
Allows R2 to interact with my Trello accounts to automate the process of
organizing the various types of information I input into the `Inbox` list of
my root board (`src`)

## Card Address
My Trello is organized into an arbitrary set of boards, each of which contains
a set of lists that follow a given pattern.
