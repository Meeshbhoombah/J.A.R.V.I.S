# Trello
The Trello service allows R2 to interact with my Trello to:
- Allow bulk manipulation of cards

## The Card Address
My Trello is organized into an arbitrary set of boards, each of which has its
own method for organizing the lists within the boards. Generally, the higher
the position a card takes in a list, the greater its priority.
